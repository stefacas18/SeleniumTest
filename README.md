# SeleniumTest

can you find any bugs on this page?

- They need to improve the validation in the field amount, beacuse when you write a invalid value, always creates the same page using a default value (5), depends of the option you select.
     
- The page takes a lot of time to load

- When you select the list option, the generated page shows 5 lists, but in the report line it says 5 Paragraphs, but the true in HTML has 10 paragraph elements (<p>), 
     	for that reason the report line is incorrect, it should say 5 Lists not Paragraphs.
